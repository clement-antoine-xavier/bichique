# Check your C++ Compiler

To get started with **Bichique**, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up on your development machine:

- A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) that supports C++20 or later.
- A C++ build system (e.g., CMake, Make, or your preferred IDE).
- A code editor or IDE with C++ support (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Visual Studio).

## Verify your C++ compiler

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

- For Linux/macOS with GCC:

```bash
g++ --version
```

- For Linux/macOS with Clang:

```bash
clang++ --version
```

- For Windows with MSVC, open the "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio" and run:

```bash
cl
```

Ensure that the version displayed is C++20 compliant or later.
